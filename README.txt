This is a small sample application created during the interview process at Wisp using Python and Flask.

To run the program, activate the included virtual_env and run the command 'run flask.'

While the server is running, send a GET request to 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/specialmath/<num>' where <num> is the number you would like to retrieve the value for.

A simple data store utilizing Python's shelf is included to store previously calculated values.
